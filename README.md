## Description
> The main purpose of this project was to build a game for my Second Milestone Project as a part of the Full Stack Web Developer Diploma course, using knowledge of HTML and CSS and JavaScript.

The game should be easy and fun to play, but at the same time challenging enough to keep the user engaged for a long time.

# Additional Info:
I want to apologize for the lack of commits and the overall state of my project, which should have been a lot better. Unfortunately I was experiencing some serious familiy issues in the last two months and was not able to commit any time to it until the very last moment, when I had to build the project for a single day.
